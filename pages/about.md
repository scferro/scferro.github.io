# **About Me**
<br>
<font size="+1">
Hi! I'm Stephen Ferro, a robotics student currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Robotics from Northwestern University. I previously graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 2018. During my time at Purdue, I played a pivotal role in the success of the Purdue FSAE Electric team, achieving their best results ever in the Skidpad and Autocross events. My professional journey led me to SKF USA, where I initially served as an Application Engineer, collaborating with industrial, defense, and robotics industries. In this role, I assisted customers in specifying bearings and seals, provided design recommendations based on customer requirements, and conducted bearing life and failure analyses. In 2022, I transitioned into a Product Design Engineer role at SKF, contributing to the design of pitch and yaw slewing bearings for wind turbines used by customers worldwide.

I have always been fascinated by robots and have studied robotics as a hobby for several years. Therefore, I was thrilled to join the Northwestern University Masters of Science in Robotics program in 2023. Now, as a student at Northwestern, I have the opportunity to further enhance my expertise in the field of robotics through diverse projects involving autonomous vehicles, robotic arms, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These projects and more are documented in this portfolio for you to explore. Proficient in Python, C++, SolidWorks, and various manufacturing processes, my focus remains on finding opportunities to contribute to the ongoing advancements in the field of robotics.
