### Overview
The goal of this project was to develop an actuator for future use in a quadruped robot. The actuator was 3D printed, and used a cycloidal drive to transmit power from a 5008 brushless motor to the output. The design also incorporates a built in encoder for tracking position. It was designed to be economical to produce while still being relatively small and light - these goals were met, with an estimated cost of <$60, a mass of 454g, and âŒ€80mm x 67mm size. It was also able to achieve >12 Nm of torque during testing. Based on this success prototypes for a quadruped robot based on this design were built and run through initial testing. 


### Design Targets
The goals for this project were primarily around cost and manufacturability while maintaining some key features for a dynamic walling robot:
- Cost: The overall actuator design should
