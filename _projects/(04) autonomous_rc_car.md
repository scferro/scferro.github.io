### Overview
For this project, I built an autonomous RC car from scratch and programmed it to drive autonomously. I created a set of ROS 2 packages it to allow the car to drag race with traction control, drive from point to point, and race laps. I also used NVidia Isaac Sim to create an environment for testing and tuning new code before deploying it on the robot itself. 

### WORK IN PROGRESS - check back at the end of March for an update
