### Overview
In this project, I implemented a SLAM algorithm using an extended Kalman filter from scratch on a Turtlebot3. I also created a simulation environment using ROS2 and RViz for testing and tuning robot control and the SLAM algorithm. 

### WORK IN PROGRESS - check back at the end of March for an update
